Angular + Google Firebase app. Advertise your concerts, check for cool events in your area and attend meet other musicians. All of this is available, thanks to this app. It was made as a university project, probably won't be developed anymore though. App is responsive, connected to database using Google Firebase, adapted to the WCAG rules. Main goal was to design intuitive, working form, that checks if your input is correct.

Deleted connection to database from source files for obvious reasons. If you want to check how it works, click this link: https://stowarzyszeniemuzycznedb.web.app

Also, raw code probably won't work on your PC, as it needs additional packages, not included in this repo. Whole directory with all packages would kill my internet. This code is just for preview, sorry.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
